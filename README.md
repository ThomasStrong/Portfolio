## Overview

Monolith Lapidary Landing Page - This project is creating a product/service landing page for Monolith Lapidary, an imaginary business that cuts and shapes gemstones for use in jewelry and other applications. The goal is to provide a clean, succinct site for the business that allows users/guests to sample a few stones, read testimonials from happy customers, and to offer different lapidary products and services as provided by the business.
The site is a single page, with JavaScript functions created to hide certain sections, or "pages". The author does, in fact, have a lapidary hobby that will be reflected in the use of personal images in the product gallery. The site continues to be modified as necessary for user experience.
